# Arkanoid-BrickGame
Arkanoid-BrickGame is a classic brick-breaker game developed in Java during my first year of computer science studies. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns, along with game mechanics, collision detection, and interactive graphics, recreating the nostalgic experience of arcade games.
